# Test Smells To Flag

- Assertion removal or dilution.
- Replacing exact checks with weak truthy checks.
- New skip/xfail markers without accepted rationale.
- Over-broad mocking that hides behavior changes.
- Updating golden snapshots without semantic validation.
- Tests passing while touched production paths remain untested.
