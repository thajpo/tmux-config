# Interrogation Questions

Ask and resolve these before promotion:
1. What exact behavior changes?
2. What must not change?
3. What files/surfaces are in-scope vs out-of-scope?
4. What is the fail-first test?
5. What regression tests are required?
6. What risks and rollback triggers exist?
7. Does this overlap another item? Merge or split?
